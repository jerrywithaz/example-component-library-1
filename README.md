# Example Component Library

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how I would go about organizing a design system into a component library. The design system that I am using is [https://www.duetds.com/](https://www.duetds.com). 

I've taken their design tokens and codified them into a theme to be used with styled-components.

The theme is defined in `src/theme`.
